Basic Rules

To start the game, each player draws ten White Cards.

The person who most recently pooped begins as the Card Czar and plays a Black Card.  The Card Czar reads the question or fill-in-the-blank phrase on the Black Card out loud.

Everyone else answers the question or fills in the blank by passing one White Card, face down, to the Card Czar.  

The Card Czar shuffles all of the answers and shares each combination with the group.  For full effect, the Card Czar should usually re-read the Black Card before presenting each answer.  The Card Czar then picks the funniest play, and whoever submitted it gets one Awesome Point.

After the round, a new player becomes the Card Czar, and everyone draws back up to ten White Cards.

Pick 2

Some cards say PICK 2 on the bottom.  

To answer these, each player plays two White Cards in combinaton.  Play them in th eorder that the Card Czar should read them -- the order matters.

If the Card Czar has lobster claws for hands, you can use paperclips to secure the cards in the right order.
